☕ Java OOP Practice Project

Java project developed during the Java10x course, focused on strengthening Object-Oriented Programming fundamentals and core language concepts.

🎯 Project Overview

This project was created as a hands-on way to practice Java fundamentals by modeling a fictional domain (inspired by an anime universe) to simulate characters, abilities, missions and ranking systems.

The goal was to transform theory into practical implementation using a creative but structured domain model.

🧠 Concepts Applied

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Encapsulation

Inheritance

Polymorphism

Constructors

Interfaces

Collections Framework

Stack data structure

Exception handling

Basic clean code practices

🏗 Project Structure

The system simulates:

Characters with different ranks and abilities

Skill execution logic

Stack-based action system

Domain modeling with class hierarchy

The focus is not the theme itself, but the technical implementation of Java concepts.

🚀 Learning Goals

Strengthen understanding of OOP pillars

Improve domain modeling skills

Practice data structure usage in real scenarios

Write organized and maintainable Java code

📌 Next Improvements

Add battle simulation logic

Implement persistence layer

Improve separation of responsibilities

Refactor applying SOLID principles
