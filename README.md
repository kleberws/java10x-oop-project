☕ Java OOP Domain Modeling Project
This project was developed during the Java10x course as a hands-on initiative to strengthen core Java and Object-Oriented Programming concepts through structured domain modeling.
Instead of using generic examples, the system was designed around a fictional universe to simulate real business rules, hierarchical structures, and stack-based logic execution.

🎯 Technical Focus
The main objective of this project is to demonstrate practical understanding of:
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Encapsulation and abstraction
Inheritance and polymorphism
Interface implementation
Domain modeling
Java Collections Framework
Stack data structure (LIFO logic simulation)
Exception handling
Code organization and readability

🏗 Architecture Approach

The system models:

Entity hierarchy with role differentiation
Ability execution logic
Stack-based action flow
Clear separation of responsibilities

Although the theme is fictional, the design decisions follow structured programming principles similar to real-world backend systems.

💡 What This Project Demonstrates
Ability to translate theoretical concepts into structured code
Understanding of class relationships and object behavior
Practical application of data structures in business logic
Clean and maintainable code organization

🚀 Next Steps

Improve architecture applying SOLID principles
Introduce persistence layer
Add unit testing
Refactor to enhance scalability
